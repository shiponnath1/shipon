Global sales of automobiles are forecast to fall to just under 70 million units in 2021, down from a peak of almost 80 million units in 2017.
The auto industry's most important industry segments include commercial vehicles and passenger cars. China is counted among the largest automobile 
markets worldwide, both in terms of sales and production. Car sales in China dipped for the first time in 2018 - the market cratered in 
February 2020 but bounced back shortly after. The global market is poised for a recovery in 2022.
