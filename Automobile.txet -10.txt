Mass production of automobiles started in the early 1900s when Ford introduced assembly line car production to mass-manufacture the Model T. 
Today, the Ford Motor Company still ranks among the leading manufacturers of passenger cars, its most popular passenger light truck model being 
the Ford F-Series, which was also one of 2020â€™s best-selling light vehicles worldwide. The Toyota Motor Corporation is currently the best-selling 
manufacturer of motor vehicles, closely followed by the Volkswagen Group. Meanwhile, electric vehicle maker Tesla emerged as the most valuable 
automotive brand worldwide in 2021.
