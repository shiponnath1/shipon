According to the National Automobile Dealers Association, new vehicle sales account for more than half of total sales revenue at a franchised new 
car and new truck dealers. These sales also generate additional revenue in other departments of new car dealers, which are more profitable to
the dealer. By putting new vehicles on the road, dealers can count on new repair and service customers and future trade-ins of used vehicles.
