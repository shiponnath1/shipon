With a few clicks, potential car buyers can already access a tremendous amount of
information, and the volume and breadth of the material available on the Internet will only
increase. In 2012, 70 percent of buyers stated the Internet as a major source for information gathering, displacing brochures, ads, and test 
reports (Exhibit 8). Five years ago, customers visited dealers an average of five times before purchasing a car; now they enter the

phases. This presents OEMs with contrasting challenges. On the one hand, they need to create a state-of-the-art Web presence that provides customers with a digitally supported 
purchasing experience based
on, for example, comparison tools, car configurators, and other online tools. On the other
