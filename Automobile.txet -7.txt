Manufaturers in the automobile industry could consider positioning themselves long-term in the areas of e-motor design and/or manufacturing, 
battery packaging, and integration. In addition, electronics and software will play a dominant role in vehicle innovation. Approximately 90 percent
 of automotive innovations in 2012 featured electronics and software, especially in active safety and infotainment options. Since those 
capabilities will be crucial, OEMs should consider solutions like developing “vertical partnerships” with their preferred suppliers. 
These would allow OEMs to cut R&D costs while also developing and implementing new features faster.
